## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111928259/215292918-a1db4d21-9648-4939-ab39-56d430f94538.png)

### As you can see from the screenshot, the variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values were Vehicle Length, Vehicle Weight, Spoiler Angle, Ground Clearance, and whether or not the vehicle had All Wheel Drive. 
### The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, as the P-Value for the F-statistic is less than 0.05. This shows a significant relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable. 
### Yes, the linear model does predict the MPG of MechaCar prototypes. The R-squared value of 0.7149 shows that the variance in mpg values is explained by the predictor variables based on the model.
